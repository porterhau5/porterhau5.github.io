My name is Tom Porter and I currently reside in the Washington, D.C. area. The primary focus of my job is penetration testing, however my roots are on the blue team. I hold a handful of certifications from SANS ([GPEN](http://www.giac.org/certification/penetration-tester-gpen), [GCIH](http://www.giac.org/certification/certified-incident-handler-gcih), [GCIA](http://www.giac.org/certification/certified-intrusion-analyst-gcia)), as well as Bachelor of Science degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. I enjoy scripting, participating in CTFs, dissecting packets, automation & DevOps, toying with Arduinos, password analysis, and baseball. I draw inspiration from my brother who is a [data science wizard and hackathon guru](http://benporter.io).

I work for [PSC](http://paysw.com/). Many of my colleagues there maintain blogs, and I highly recommend checking out the cool stuff they're working on:

 * [The Stone Zone](http://thestone.zone)
 * [Subversionary Learning](http://lo-sec.ninja)
 * [Popped.io](https://popped.io)
 * [Pentester Tips](http://www.pentester.tips)
