I've had aspirations of getting a blog going for some time, so this is an attempt at it. I imagine it will mostly serve as a means to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging" target="_blank">rubber duck</a> some tool or method I'm working on, but hopefully someone else out there will benefit from a useful command or tidbit found here.

I plan on including general observations from recent penetration tests, scripts that have improved my quality of life, comments on the research my colleagues or I am working on, thoughts about recent events in the InfoSec world, maybe a <a href="http://braves.com" target="_blank">Braves</a> rant or two, and whatever else I find interesting. Find out a little more about me [here](/about/).
