I've had aspirations of getting a blog going for some time, so this is an attempt at it. I imagine it will mostly serve as a means to [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) some tool or method I'm working on, but hopefully someone else out there will benefit from a useful command or tidbit found here.

I plan on including general observations from recent penetration tests, scripts that have improved my quality of life, comments on the research my colleagues or I am working on, thoughts about recent events in the InfoSec world, maybe a [Braves](http://braves.com) rant or two, and whatever else I find interesting. Find out a little more about me [here](/about/).
